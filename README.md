# Initiate [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/infinum/initiate.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/infinum/initiate)

Initiate is the base Rails application used at
[Infinum](https://infinum.co). It's a fork of [Suspenders](https://github.com/thoughtbot/suspenders) by [Thoughtbot](thoughtbot.com). Thnx Thoughtbot!


## Installation

First install the initiate gem:

    gem install initiate

Then run:

    initiate projectname

This will create a Rails app in `projectname` using the latest version of Rails.

## Gemfile

To see the latest and greatest gems, look at Initiate'
[Gemfile](templates/Gemfile.erb), which will be appended to the default
generated projectname/Gemfile.

It includes application gems like:

* [Bugsnag](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-ruby) for exception notification
* [Delayed Job](https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job) for background
  processing
* [Flutie](https://github.com/thoughtbot/flutie) for `page_title` and `body_class` view
  helpers
* [Postgres](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg) for access to the Postgres database
* [Recipient Interceptor](https://github.com/croaky/recipient_interceptor) to
  avoid accidentally sending emails to real people from staging
* [Simple Form](https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form) for form markup
  and style
* [Title](https://github.com/calebthompson/title) for storing titles in
  translations

And development gems like:

* [Dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) for loading environment variables
* [Pry Rails](https://github.com/rweng/pry-rails) for interactively exploring
  objects
* [ByeBug](https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/byebug) for interactively
  debugging behavior
* [Bundler Audit](https://github.com/rubysec/bundler-audit) for scanning the
  Gemfile for insecure dependencies based on published CVEs
* [Spring](https://github.com/rails/spring) for fast Rails actions via
  pre-loading
* [Better errors](https://github.com/charliesome/better_errors) for better debugging via
  in-browser IRB consoles.
* [Quiet Assets](https://github.com/evrone/quiet_assets) for muting assets
  pipeline log messages

And testing gems like:

* [Capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara) and
  [Capybara Webkit](https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit) for
  integration testing
* [Factory Girl](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl) for test data
* [Formulaic](https://github.com/thoughtbot/formulaic) for integration testing
  HTML forms
* [RSpec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec) for unit testing
* [RSpec Mocks](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-mocks) for stubbing and spying
* [Shoulda Matchers](https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda-matchers) for common
  RSpec matchers
* [Timecop](https://github.com/jtrupiano/timecop-console) for testing time

## Other goodies

Initiate also comes with:

* The [`./bin/setup`][setup] convention for new developer setup
* Rails' flashes set up and in application layout
* A few nice time formats set up for localization
* `Rack::Deflater` to [compress responses with Gzip][compress]
* [Safe binstubs][binstub]
* [t() and l() in specs without prefixing with I18n][i18n]
* An automatically-created `SECRET_KEY_BASE` environment variable in all
  environments

## Spring

Initiate uses [spring](https://github.com/rails/spring) by default.
It makes Rails applications load faster, but it might introduce confusing issues
around stale code not being refreshed.
If you think your application is running old code, run `spring stop`.
And if you'd rather not use spring, add `DISABLE_SPRING=1` to your login file.

## Dependencies

Initiate requires the latest version of Ruby.

Some gems included in Initiate have native extensions. You should have GCC
installed on your machine before generating an app with Initiate.

Use [OS X GCC Installer](https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer/) for
Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6).

Use [Command Line Tools for XCode](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action)
for Lion (OS X 10.7) or Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8).

We use [Capybara Webkit](https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit) for
full-stack JavaScript integration testing. It requires QT. Instructions for
installing QT are
[here](https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit/wiki/Installing-Qt-and-compiling-capybara-webkit).

PostgreSQL needs to be installed and running for the `db:create` rake task.
